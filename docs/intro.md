# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This AI-native book covers the complete stack from robotic middleware to AI-powered control systems.

## Modules

This book is organized into four comprehensive modules:

### [Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](/docs/ros2/chapters/chapter1)
- [Chapter 1: ROS 2 as the Robotic Nervous System](/docs/ros2/chapters/chapter1) - Understanding ROS 2 as the middleware backbone of humanoid robots
- [Chapter 2: ROS 2 Communication Primitives](/docs/ros2/chapters/chapter2) - Core communication patterns: topics, services, and actions
- [Chapter 3: Bridging Python AI Agents to ROS 2 Controllers](/docs/ros2/chapters/chapter3) - Connecting AI agents to ROS 2 using rclpy
- [Chapter 4: Modeling Humanoid Robots with URDF](/docs/ros2/chapters/chapter4) - Structural modeling for simulation and deployment consistency

### Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- Gazebo simulation fundamentals
- Unity digital twin integration
- Physics simulation and collision detection
- Sensor simulation and data synthesis

### Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
- NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem overview
- Perception systems (Vision, LIDAR, IMU)
- Planning and navigation
- Control systems and actuation

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
- Multimodal AI fundamentals
- Vision-language models for robotics
- Action generation and execution
- End-to-end VLA systems

## Interactive Learning

This book features an integrated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot that allows you to ask questions about the content and receive accurate, source-attributed responses. The chatbot is trained exclusively on this book's content to ensure accuracy and relevance.

## Getting Started

Begin with Module 1 to establish the foundational understanding of ROS 2, the backbone of modern robotic systems. Each module builds upon the previous ones, creating a comprehensive understanding of Physical AI and humanoid robotics.
