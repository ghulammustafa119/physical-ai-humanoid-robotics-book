# Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

This directory contains the content for Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book, covering AI decision-making systems for humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac™ as the simulation and training environment.

## Chapter Structure

1. **Chapter 1: What Is an AI-Robot Brain?**
   - Understanding the AI brain concept and layered intelligence
   - Classical control vs AI-driven systems comparison
   - Layered system responsibilities (Perception → Planning → Action)
   - NVIDIA Isaac™ positioning as simulation tool

2. **Chapter 2: Perception in Physical AI Systems**
   - Humanoid robot sensors (camera, depth, IMU, joints)
   - Perception pipelines and data processing
   - Sensor fusion concepts and approaches
   - Isaac Sim for perception testing and synthetic data

3. **Chapter 3: Planning & Decision Making**
   - Task planning vs motion planning
   - Reactive vs deliberative behaviors
   - Learned policies vs rule-based logic
   - Failure handling and replanning strategies

4. **Chapter 4: Bridging the AI Brain to ROS 2**
   - Python AI agents as ROS 2 nodes
   - Decision-to-ROS 2 action transformation
   - Closed-loop feedback and adaptive behavior
   - Integration patterns and best practices

## Technical Requirements

- All code examples use Python with rclpy for ROS 2 integration
- Content follows Docusaurus Markdown format with proper frontmatter
- Technical claims verified against official Isaac/ROS documentation
- RAG-ready structure with clean section headers
- Conceptual explanations with Python-style pseudocode examples
- Textual descriptions of diagrams (no images required)

## Target Audience

- Advanced undergraduate or graduate CS/AI students
- Learners interested in AI-driven robotics systems
