# Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for Humanoid Robots

This module covers Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems for humanoid robots, exploring how modern robotics integrates visual perception, natural language understanding, and action execution in unified frameworks.

## Overview

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems represent a paradigm shift in robotics, enabling humanoid robots to perceive their environment through vision, interpret human instructions through natural language, and execute complex actions to achieve goals. This integrated approach moves beyond traditional robotics, where perception, decision-making, and action were treated as separate modules.

## Learning Objectives

In this module, you will learn:

- Foundational concepts of multimodal perception in VLA systems
- Transformer-based architectures for vision-language models
- Action planning and execution frameworks for humanoid robots
- Integration of VLA systems with ROS 2
- Testing and evaluation of VLA systems in simulation

## Module Structure

1. **Introduction to VLA**: Foundational concepts and multimodal perception
2. **Vision-Language Models**: Transformer architectures and attention mechanisms
3. **Action Planning & Execution**: Connecting VLM outputs to robot actions
4. **Integration & Simulation**: Complete system integration and evaluation

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have completed:
- Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- Basic understanding of Python and neural networks

## Target Audience
